In the first stage, a matrix \(M\) is given. Note that the matrix is symmetric. The eigen values and eigen vectors of matrix \(M\) are given. In the applet to the right, you will be selecting vector \(P\) and notice the vector \(Q \) displayed, which is the calculated as \(Q = M P\) . Notice the ratio of projections of vector \(Q\) on the eigen vectors. Complete the quiz go to the next stage.

In this stage, you will be selecting vectors \(P\) of same length, and notice the length of the resultant vector \(Q = M P\) . When is the length of \(Q\) maximum or minimum ?
