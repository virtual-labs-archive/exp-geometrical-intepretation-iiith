Let \(\{\lambda_i, i =1,N\}\) and \(\{\vec v_i, i = 1,N\}\) denote the set of eigen values and the corresponding set of eigen vectors for the matrix \({\bf M}\). For a randomly selected input vector \(P\), let the resultant vector be \(Q= MP\).


Answer following questions for this eigen system.

Q1. All but one of the eigen values are zero. If the input vector \(P\) is a point in \(N\)-dimensional space selected at random, the \(\vec Q\) will be
a single point
will lie on a single line
will lie on a plane
None of the above


Q2. None of the eigen values are zero, and not all of them are equal. If the input vector \(P\) is a point in \(N\)-dimensional space on a sphere, the \(\vec Q\) will be
a single point
will lie on a single line
will lie on a sphere
will lie on a ellipse
